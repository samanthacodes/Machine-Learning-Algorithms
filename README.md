# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository hosts a collection of machine learning algorithms, including various techniques and models for solving different types of problems, covering a wide range of ML tasks, from regression to advanced sequence processing.

Regression Algorithms: Implementations of linear regression, polynomial regression, and other regression techniques for predictive modeling.

Decision Trees: Decision tree algorithms, including both classification and regression tree implementations, for creating tree-based models.

Random Forest: Ensemble learning methods like Random Forest, which combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Code and examples of SVM algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

Image Classification: Deep learning models for image classification tasks, using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Recommender Systems: Collaborative filtering and content-based recommender system implementations for personalized recommendations.

Sequence Processing: Algorithms and models for sequence data, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).
